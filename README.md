# Probability-Analysis
This tool calculates the probability distribution of the monitoring time series during a particular eruptive phase (like lava extrusion, intrusion etc.), and compares it to the repose periods and precursors. This allows to identify quantitatively relevant thresholds in the time series that indicate an active phase in the volcano.
